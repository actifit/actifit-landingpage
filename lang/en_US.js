	a20: 'Make sure you are using both the correct username and “private posting key” for your Actifit report. Actifit will automatically save your credentials when you report for the first time.<br/>You could be low on Resource Credits, which can cause problems when you have a limited amount of Hive Power / Steem Power. In this case you either need to wait till it has recovered or you need to increase your Hive Power/Steem Power. More information about Resource Credit can be found <a href="https://hive.blog/faq.html#How_do_Resource_Credits_work_on_the_Hive_blockchain">here</a>.<br/>We recommend that you have at least 15 HP and 15SP (in case you post on Steem as well).<br/>If in doubt, contact support on <a href="https://links.actifit.io/discord">discord</a>.',

Otherwise only the new amount will be used, and the remaining will be undelegated.',

	a23: 'AFIT tokens can be transferred from your Profile page in the wallet. After selecting the Tip AFIT button, enter the user name and the amount of AFIT to be sent.',

User Rank determines 25% of the total reward value. The ranking system is scaled from 0 (lowest) to 100+, and is affected by a multitude of factors, while making it a dynamic system, as follows:<br/><li>Amount of Delegated Steem/HIVE Power (SP/HP)</li><li>Amount of Held AFIT Tokens</li><li>Total Activity Rewarded</li><li>Last 10 Days Activity Count</li><li>Amount of AFITX held on Hive-Engine, Steem-Engine and on BSC, whether in liquid or locked as liquidity vs BNB or BUSD</li><br/>You can check more details about your rank on <a href="https://actifit.io/userrank">https://actifit.io/userrank</a> ',
